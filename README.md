# Pet-Hotel-Program

Pet hotel program for dogs and cats that will handle admission/capacity.
Will simply track how many available spots for each species pet in the hotel, the length of stay, if grooming is requested, and assigns the admitted pet to a spot.
With an easy implementation of cost per day and cost for grooming it can calculate the total cost for length of stay and services provided.
